## General info
The background changer in web design refers to a feature that allows users to change the background color, image, or pattern of a website. This feature is often used to create a more personalized and visually appealing user experience. Background changers can be particularly useful for websites that want to offer a range of customization options to their users. For example, a social networking site may allow users to choose from a range of background colors or images to personalize their profile pages.
